# **PREDICTING ILLEGAL DUMPSITES** [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.com/ramanshsharma2806/Predicting-Dumpsites.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.com/ramanshsharma2806/Predicting-Dumpsites)

## Introduction

I recently volunteered as a Machine Learning Engineer in [Omdena](https://omdena.com/)'s TrashOut project - [Link](https://omdena.com/projects/ai-illegal-dumping/).

Throughout this project, our team of 50 AI and Data Science experts from around the world worked to achieve 3 broad goals:

1. Build models on illegal dumpsites to see if there are any patterns that can help to understand what causes illegal dumpsites, predict potential dumpsites, and how to avoid such dumpsites.

2. Develop a classifier to identify if a shopping product is sustainable and environmentally friendly and to which recycling bin it belongs.

3. The project community helps to recommend how to keep the database of dumpsites updated to serve all interested parties and make cleanups more efficient.

## Contributions

While I contributed and collaborated in many parts of the project, one of my heaviest contributions was on experimenting with different Neural Network architectures to see if this class of AI algorithms was suitable for predicting potential illegal dumpsites.


This repository contains the jupyter notebook that I worked on with other collaborators to experiment with numerous variations of different Neural Networks. It contains explanatory documentation, descriptive graphs, and classification metrics.
